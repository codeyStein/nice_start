# Flutter nice_start
A simple way to start a flutter application

## Why?
	I was kind of bored and thought this might help boost productivity too :D (at least a little).

## Instalation
1. download or copy the contents from `./fnc.sh`
2. add executable permisions by using `chmod +x ./fnc.sh` (make sure to have the right directory)
3. run `./fnc.sh` and start hacking! Example app: `./fnc.sh example_app`
*tip: alias or add ./fnc.sh to $PWD so it's exceutable anywhere!*

## Screenshots
